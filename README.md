# Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou Class Problem

Myy final project for Applied Mathematics 129: Foundations of Scientific Computing at
University of California, Santa Cruz was to create a simulation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem.

The numerical calculations were performed using Fortran. The data visualization was performed using Python.
utility.f90 and portions of setup_module.f90 were given by my professor Ian May.

##Files included

utility.f90
fput.f90
setup_module.f90
leapfrog_module.f90
output_module.f90
plot.py
